# Finance Module Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Finance Module for the Family Medical App extends the application's functionality to include comprehensive financial management features across three distinct scopes:

1. **Personal Finance Management**
2. **Nuclear Family Finance Management**
3. **Extended Family Financial Services**

This document outlines the technical specifications, data models, security considerations, and implementation details for the Finance Module.

      date: Timestamp
    }>
  }>,
  createdBy: String, // userId
  createdAt: Timestamp,

}
```

## Access Control & Security

### Personal Finance

- Data is stored with `scope: "personal"` flag
- Access is limited to the owner by default
- Owner can explicitly share access with specific family members
- Firestore security rules ensure only the owner and explicitly shared users can read/write
- Encrypted storage for sensitive financial information

### Nuclear Family Finance

- Data is stored with `scope: "nuclear"` flag
- Access is controlled via the existing FamilySharingContext
- Only nuclear family members have access
- Optional child access control for parents to restrict children's access
- Encrypted data transmission and storage

### Extended Family Services

- Data is stored with `scope: "extended"` flag
- Project-based access control
- Only contributors to specific projects can access those project details
- Welfare accounts only visible to participating members

## Firebase Implementation

### Firestore Collections

- `finance_accounts`
- `finance_transactions`
- `finance_projects`
- `finance_loans`
- `finance_welfare_accounts`

### Firestore Rules (Examples)

```
match /finance_accounts/{accountId} {
  allow read, write: if 
    (resource.data.owner == request.auth.uid) || 
    (request.auth.uid in resource.data.sharedWith);
}

match /finance_transactions/{transactionId} {
  allow read, write: if 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/finance_accounts/$(resource.data.accountId)).data.owner == request.auth.uid ||
    request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/finance_accounts/$(resource.data.accountId)).data.sharedWith;
}

match /finance_projects/{projectId} {
  allow read, write: if 
    (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid) ||
    (request.auth.uid in resource.data.contributors[*].userId);
}
```

## Integration with Existing App Features

### User Authentication

Leverage existing `AuthContext` for user authentication and access control.

### Family Management

Utilize the existing `FamilySharingContext` to manage nuclear and extended family relationships.

### Notifications

Extend the current notification system to include:
- Payment reminders
- Contribution notifications
- Budget alerts
- Loan repayment reminders

### Offline Support

- Implement offline transaction recording
- Sync with Firestore when connectivity is restored
- Use `offlineStorage.js` service for local data persistence

## UI/UX Design Principles

- Consistent with existing app design language
- Clear visual distinction between personal, nuclear, and extended family financial data
- Color-coded account types and transaction categories
- Informative dashboards with graphical representations of financial data
- Intuitive navigation between different financial management sections

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Data Synchronization

- **Solution**: Hierarchical Firestore rules with helper functions for access verification

### Offline Functionality
- **Challenge**: Maintaining financial data integrity during offline periods
- **Solution**: Local-first architecture with conflict resolution strategies

### Performance
- **Challenge**: Handling potentially large transaction histories
- **Solution**: Pagination, lazy loading, and data aggregation for reports

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for financial calculation utilities

- Mock tests for offline functionality
- E2E tests for critical financial workflows
- Security rule tests to verify access control implementation

## Deployment Plan
